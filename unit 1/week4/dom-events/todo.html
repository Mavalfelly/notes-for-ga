<!--in HTML there is a concept of blocking html tags vs non-blocking html tags
blocking means they take up the entire width by default. Although we can override the default behavior with CSS, by default adding things after a blocking tag means they will stack on top of one another.
non-blocking tags are tags that only take up the needed space. And adding multiple non-blocking tags means they are side by side-->
